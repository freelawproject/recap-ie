RECAP for IE
============

*A RECAP extension for Internet Explorer*


Status
------

**WARNING**: This extension has yet to be completed, and likely never will be. It was an experiment in creating a RECAP version for Internet Explorer, but with IE Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome coming together around Web Extensions, it doesn't make any sense to devote resources here.

In particular, the following remains to be done:

* Making methods that make HTTP requests in `class RECAP()` asynchronous.
* Debugging interactions with PACER websites.
* Creating an installation package using NSIS.

Installation
------------

Currently, the extension must be installed manually:

1. Open Command Prompt using admnistrator privileges.
2. Find `RegAsm.exe` in a .NET v4.0 directory.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the compiled `RECAP.dll`.
4. Run `RegAsm.exe /codebase RECAP.dll`.

Once installed, "RECAP.BHO" should appear in IE as an add-on.


To uninstall manually:

1. Open Command Prompt using admnistrator privileges.
2. Find `RegAsm.exe` in a .NET v4.0 directory.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the compiled `RECAP.dll`.
4. Run `RegAsm.exe /unregister RECAP.dll`.


`RegAsm.exe` is usually found in directories like these:

    C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.xxxxx\RegAsm.exe
    C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.xxxxx\RegAsm.exe

(For 32-bit IE and 64-bit IE, respectively.)


The compiled `RECAP.dll` can be found under the `bin` directory:

    .\RECAP\bin\Release\RECAP.dll
